# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This guide was created to be an early-learning tool for the basics of front-end web
design. It was created by a student, based on short lessons provided by edX, with the 
aim of assisting the student to learn some fundamental aspects through the process of 
learning-in-action. 
The resultant web page is separated into 4 main categories representing key building blocks:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. These are separated into boxes generated in CSS.
In addition to the initial learning intention, the website acts as an aide memoire for the creator, and to provide key information for other new learners when the webpage goes live.
There is also an interactive element: the viewer is prompted to open the console, at which point they are presented with a randomly-generated suggestion for the day's learning topic, from one of the four aforementioned categories.
The content is not comprehensive, due to time constraints, but rather a snapshot of what the 
content creator found interesting, novel, potentially useful or difficult to remember about the prework coursework.

## Usage

/*To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:*/

/*![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)*/

On accessing the webpage through the url, you will be presented with the four boxed categories of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git, each containing brief notes on the topic. You can read the content in its entirity or individual categories at your discretion. 
Alternatively you can follow the prompt at the top of the page by opening the console in Chrome. The console can be accessed by selecting "More Tools/Developer Tools/[Console Tab]", or by shortcut (Command+Option+I on a Mac; Control+Shit+I on Windows). In the console window, all four categories will be listed. Additionally, one of the four categories will be suggested at random. A new random category can be generated by refreshing the page.
